Davids Single-Deck Blackjack!
Blackjack is one of the classic card games! Its a must know for anyone wanting to visit Las Vegas! The concept of the game is very simple. You are playing 1 on 1 against the dealer. Whoever gets closest to 21 wins! Of course it gets a bit more complicated than that, but thats the general gist of the game! Any numbered playing cards, count as those values.(For example, a 2 of spades, would be worth 2 points). The Face cards(Jack, King, Queen, Ace) however, work a bit differently. Jack,King, and Queen are all worth 10 points. Ace is the real trickster. The Ace card will automatically be counted as 11 points, UNLESS you draw too many cards and go over 21, In that case the Ace will count as 1 point. And of course the name of the game itself, BLACKJACK! A Blackjack can only occur on the first 2 cards the player or the dealer are dealt. If they add up to 21, Then youve got a Blackjack! This is the best possible scenario, because not only does it almost guarantee that you win, But it also pays you more money for getting it! Only way to "lose" if you have a blackjack, is if the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case its a push, and nobody wins/loses that round.
